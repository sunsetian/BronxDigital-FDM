# Bronx Digital y Virtual Insanity de la Feria del Millon 2020
A Babylon and Typescript starter transpiled with webpack, results in a javascript, with connection interfaces of its main functions, to be accessible from external scripts and events.

It is still in the development process and focused on a very specific project. Its more general use is not yet intuitive.

The html inside the public folder is just an example of how to call javascript from the body, with a basic configuration of css fullscreen. This html is not compiled on implementation.

The starting point of this starter has been Tim Okolowski's repository at https://github.com/oktinaut/babylonjs-typescript-starter with modifications in the webpack configuration, the update and inclusion of babylonjs libraries and the creation of connection interfaces of some functions with the outside world.
